here is the desired roadmap for MOAG, welcome to changes and scrutiny by everyone.

architecture (high priority)
    [ ] separate {server,client}.c into files and modularize
    [ ] generalize algorithms, especially for physics
    [ ] add simple scripting server side for easy changes
    [ ] generalize sprite drawing on client-side
    [ ] client side keybindings

features
    [ ] leaderboards, restored when connection lost
    [ ] admin commands, like reseting the game
    [ ] sprees for killing with added bonuses
    [ ] more interesting crate spawn intervals
    [ ] more than one weapon can be carried
    [ ] different types of tanks with varying attributes
    [ ] varying terrain
